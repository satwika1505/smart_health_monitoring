About the Project:

 Smart Health Monitoring is a Python-based interactive health risk scoring tool built with Streamlit.
 It allows users to input key health parameters and calculates risk scores to provide insights into potential health concerns.
 The focus is on functional health analysis rather than polished UI, making it ideal for data-driven monitoring and rapid prototyping.

Features:

--> Health Risk Scoring: Users enter vital health parameters (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels) to calculate personalized risk scores.
--> Immediate Feedback: Provides instant insights based on the computed risk scores.
--> Lightweight & Interactive: Runs entirely in Streamlit without the need for heavy backend infrastructure.
--> Simple Data Handling: Accepts input via manual entry or CSV for quick analysis.

Tech Stack:

--> Python: Core logic and risk score calculations.
--> Streamlit: Interactive interface to input data and display results.
--> NumPy / Pandas: Data handling and processing.
--> Scikit-learn (optional): If any predictive models are used for risk assessment.
